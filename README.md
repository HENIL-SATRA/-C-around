# C-around
A comprehensive system to help blind people know objects around them using deep learning, image processing and facial recognition techniques. We convert all the analysis from the camera module to audio format for the blind people to hear.
We have incorporated distance measuring, facial recognition, object identification and text to speech audio output. We have made our own hardware module using Arduino Uno, servo motors, Ultrasonic sensors and MPU 6050 for self stabilizing, gimble-like image capturing stick for the blind people. 
We also have a user interface for the application.
